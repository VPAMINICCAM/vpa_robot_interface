# VPA Robot Car Interface

The package of VPA Car interface aims to contains all sensors, actuators drivers in one package. Thhis package is therefore free of any high-level logic but only performing commands from other sensors.

This package is again branched by the type of robot.

## Nanocar
The Nanocar 2WD ackerman robotic car has been a good platform of studying ROS, however, mostly not avaliable in English. There is no plan of introducing more of this type in the lab.
We would like to creat a branch that combining interface function of the RC in this package.
